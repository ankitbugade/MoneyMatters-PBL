                     <h4>Home Affordability Calculator</h4> 
                        <p>The 3 - 20 - 20 - 30 rule is a guideline often used by individuals considering purchasing a house using a home loan. It provides a structured approach to ensure financial stability and affordability throughout the home buying process.</p>
                </div> 
                <div class="info"> 
                    <h4>Understanding the 3 - 20 - 20 - 30 Rule
                    </h4>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">3:</span>  This number represents the maximum percentage of your gross monthly income that should be allocated towards your monthly mortgage payment. This includes the principal, interest, property taxes, and homeowner's insurance (often referred to as PITI). Keeping this portion of your income within 3% helps ensure that your monthly mortgage payments remain manageable and do not overburden your budget.<br>
                    <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">20:</span> The next aspect of the rule pertains to the down payment. It suggests that you should aim to provide a down payment of at least 20% of the total purchase price of the home. A higher down payment not only reduces the amount you need to borrow but also helps you secure more favorable loan terms, such as lower interest rates and avoiding private mortgage insurance (PMI).
                    <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">20:</span> This part of the rule advises limiting other debt payments, such as credit card debt, auto loans, and student loans, to no more than 20% of your gross monthly income. By keeping your debt-to-income ratio at or below this threshold, you ensure that you have sufficient income to cover your housing expenses comfortably while also managing other financial obligations.
                    <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">30:</span> The final component of the rule relates to the total housing expenses as a percentage of your gross monthly income. In addition to your mortgage payment, this includes other housing-related expenses such as utilities, maintenance, and association fees. The guideline suggests that these combined expenses should not exceed 30% of your gross monthly income. Adhering to this limit helps ensure that you have enough disposable income to cover other essential living expenses and save for the future.

                    <h4>Benefits of Following the 3 - 20 - 20 - 30 Rule</h4>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Financial Stability:</span> By adhering to these guidelines, you establish a solid financial foundation that promotes stability and minimizes the risk of financial strain.</p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Affordability:</span> Keeping housing costs within manageable limits ensures that you can comfortably afford your home without sacrificing other financial goals or lifestyle choices.</p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Risk Mitigation:</span> A higher down payment reduces the risk of being underwater on your mortgage and provides a buffer against potential fluctuations in the housing market.</p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Improved Loan Terms:</span> Meeting the recommended down payment threshold and maintaining a favorable debt-to-income ratio can result in more favorable loan terms and lower overall borrowing costs.</p>
